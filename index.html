    <h1>For My Favourite Player</h1>
    <p>There’s something I’ve been wanting to tell you.</p>
    <button onclick="openLetter()">Open the Letter</button>

    <div class="letter" id="letter">
      <p>My love,</p>

      <p>I don’t even know where to begin, because no amount of words will ever fully capture what you mean to me. Loving you has been one of the easiest and most beautiful things my heart has ever done. You inspire me in ways you probably don’t even realise, just by being you.</p>

      <p>Watching you play makes me so proud. Whether it’s rugby or football, you give everything on that pitch – your strength, your focus, your passion. You play with heart, determination, and a quiet confidence that draws everyone in. You’re my favourite rugby player and my favourite football player, not just because of how talented you are, but because of the person you are behind the game.</p>

      <p>Every time I see you in your kit, chasing the ball, pushing forward, never giving up, I see someone who fights for what they care about. And that’s one of the many reasons I love you. You remind me that effort matters, that commitment matters, and that heart matters most of all.</p>

      <p><strong>Number 5 on the pitch, but number 1 in my heart.</strong></p>

      <p>You make me laugh when I need it most, you calm me without even trying, and you make ordinary moments feel special just by being there. Being with you feels like home, like safety, like warmth. I am so grateful for you, for us, and for everything we’re building together.</p>

      <p>No matter where life takes us, I’ll always be cheering you on – from the sidelines, from afar, or right beside you. I believe in you more than words can say, and I love you more than you’ll ever truly know.</p>

      <div class="signature">Always yours ❤️</div>
